							<p>Modernity is extremely advantageous to humanity in many ways: electricity, internet, airplanes, pharmaceuticals and much more; however, our biological design, like of all other animals, still remains dominated by the ancient genome. While holding the same old biology we have made two major changes in our lifestyle: we have become a lot sedentary and indoor, this probably is affecting switching of many genes and thereby giving rise to many emotional and physiological ailments.

										<h3>Wilderness</h3>
										<p>In wilderness, we meet nature. To connect with nature is to connect with something beyond humans, of which we are a part. The core of the mind is the ecological unconscious. </p>
										<code>
											“The clearest way into the Universe is through a forest wilderness.” - John Muir
										</code>

										<h3>
											Why do we need wilderness?
										</h3>

										<p>
										<a href="https://e360.yale.edu/features/ecopsychology-how-immersion-in-nature-benefits-your-health">Ecopsychology: How Immersion in Nature Benefits Your Health</a> - <strong> Jim Robbins</strong>
										<br>
										A growing body of research points to the beneficial effects that exposure to the natural world has on health, reducing stress and promoting healing. Now, policymakers, employers, and healthcare providers are increasingly considering the human need for nature in how they plan and operate.

										The lead author of a sweeping study on the health benefits of greenery, David Rojas, advises that “where you are, increase and support more green-ness around your home.” 
									</li>
									</ul>
									<blockquote>
										"A wilderness, in contrast with those areas where man and his own works dominate the landscape, is hereby recognized as an area where the earth and its community of life are untrammeled by man, where man himself is a visitor who does not remain." - US Wilderness Act
									</blockquote>
									<blockquote>
										"Thousands of tired, nerve-shaken, over-civilized people are beginning to find out that going to the mountains is going home; that wildness is a necessity; and that mountain parks and reservations are useful not only as fountains of timber and irrigating rivers, but as fountains of life." - John Muir

										<h3>Homeostasis</h3>
										<p>Homeostasis refers to the capacity of the body to maintain the stability of diverse internal variables, such as temperature, acidity, and water level, in the face of constant environmental disturbance.
										</p>
										<code>
											To return to homeostasis is to return home. - Madhur Anand
										</code>
									</header>
									<div class="content">
										<h3>How to work from home(ostasis)?</h3>
										<p>
											Is there an ideal state? More often than not we think in terms of ideal state and current state, we want to be ‘high’ - higher productivity, higher income, higher IQ, higher performance, high speed or higher state of being.

											<h3>Emotional Fitness</h3>
											<p>
												Four key aspects of emotional fitness are emotional resilience, positive emotions, cognitive flexibility and emotional well-being

											<h3> It's 2021! Why hasn't life become as easy as they promised in the 60s?</h3>
											<p>
												Each year, a new product makes life even more physically convenient - making it possible to be even more indoor and sedantary. On the other hand, emotional and mood disorders have been increasing year by year. 
												Conveniences can make a body weaker. Is poor physical fitness undercutting our emotional fitness?

											Nature contact may offer a range of human health benefits. Although much evidence is already available, much remains unknown. A robust research effort, guided by a focus on key unanswered questions, has the potential to yield high-impact, consequential public health insights.

	Nature and mental health: An ecosystem service perspective - Gregory Bratman et. al - <a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/7/eaax0903">Link</a> <br>
	Here, we first provide points of consensus across the natural, social, and health sciences on the impacts of nature experience on cognitive functioning, emotional well-being, and other dimensions of mental health. We then show how ecosystem service assessments can be expanded to include mental health, and provide a heuristic, conceptual model for doing so.

			<h3>Curated by:</h3>
			<p>
			<strong> Madhur Anand </strong> <br>
			Work: Body-Mind Coach, Co-founder - Sehatvan <br>
			Education: BA(Hons.) Psychology, MA - Clinical Psychology (Batch of 2022) - Indira Gandhi National Open University, India <br>
			Khoji Program in Green Entreprenuership and Youth Leadership - Swaraj University
		</p>
			<h3>Supported by:</h3>
			<strong></strong> <a href="https://sehatvan.in">Sehatvan - Center for Forest Fitness</a> - Bhopal, India <br> 
			<p>The project derived its name by combining an Urdu word ‘sehat’ meaning health with ‘van’, a hindi word meaning ‘forest’. The approach is guided by the Hindi word for healthy - ‘swasth’. Swasth is formed by combining two separate words ‘swa + sthit’, which mean ‘being situated in oneself’. Hence, the emotional dimension of well being/fitness has been an important element in health restoration at Sehatvan.
